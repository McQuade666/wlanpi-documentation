The WLANPi initiative started at the Wireless LAN Professionals Conference in 2016. Since then, the WLANPi has grown in to a popular addition to the toolset of many WLAN engineers. The project is constantly adding and improving the tools avaiable on the WLANPi platform to provide a richer toolset to our loyal base of users. This site has been created to provide supporting documentation to the project, to make the WLANPi even more accessible to new and exiting users. On this site we will provide information to enable you to buy or build your own WLANPi, detail the packages available on the current WLANPi image and provide update information about the WLANPi project.

The goal was to create a portable, ready-to-use device that could function as a network endpoint for measuring network performance and throughput. Since then, it has been widely embraced in the awesome wireless community and after many contributions, this tiny box has evolved well beyond a network performance testing device. Today, it can also be used as a remote Wi-Fi scanner, packet capture tool, portable Wi-Fi signal generator and much more! These capabilities assist wireless professionals with designing better wireless networks, troubleshooting issues more quickly, and validating wireless network performance. Hardware CPU At the heart of the WLAN Pi is the NanoPi NEO2, a super tiny quad-core single-board computer (SBC). The NanoPi NEO2 shares some similarities to the more well known Raspberry Pi, however the NanoPi is less than \u00bd its size, consumes less power, and it can push over 900 Mbps over its gigabit ethernet connection. Specs: CPU: Allwinner H5, Quad-core 64-bit high-performance Cortex A53 DDR3 RAM: 1GB Storage: microSD (16 GB card included), can be expanded up to 128GB More info: http://wiki.friendlyarm.com/wiki/index.php/NanoPi_NEO2 Wi-Fi Adapter The Wi-Fi adapter is a Comfast CF-912ac, Realtek rtl8812au chipset, one of the few 802.11ac chipsets that support monitor mode and packet injection in linux. Important Specs: Dual-band, 2x2:2, 802.11ac Custom Handheld Case Designed specifically for use with the WLAN Pi, houses the Wi-Fi adapter and USB-C cable, while still exposing the USB port and ethernet port on the bottom, while still allowing access to the MicroSD slot.

The items you'll need are all relatively low cost and are relatively easy to get source. There are a few options availabe to get yourself a WLANPi: Attend a WLPC conference and attend one of the WLANPi deep dive sessions Buy a complete kit from the WLPC online store Source the individual items you'll need yourself from a number of sources. Obviously, buying the kit from the WLPC store is a quick and easy option. You get the advantage of having all the components you need in one order, and the kit comes pre-assembled with a software image burned and ready to go. You also have a reputable, single source to contact if there are any issues with your purchase. However, if you're a nuts & bolts type of person who like to roll up your sleeves and build stuff yourself, you can source the various component parts yourself and build from scratch. (This will likely take you quite a lot longer to do compared to buying the kit, but arguably may be more fun and slightly cheaper). Buying a Kit If you'd like to buy a pre-built kit, check out our suppliers page . We'll keep this updated with kit buying options. Building Your Own Kit Rolling your own WLANPi takes a little more effort than a pre-built kit, but with a little effort, you can source all of the parts and put one together. Here is a list of the items you are going to need to source to build your own WLANPi: A NanoPi NEO2 from the FriendlyArm company (located in China): this is the WLANPi hardware platform itself A Comfast CF-912 USB wireless adapter: this is the currently recommended adapter to support he various wireless operations that the WLANPi supports An micro-SD to USB adapter module to allow images to be burned on to the WLANPi A USB to micro-USB cable to power and/or provide connectivity to the WLANPi (the flavour of USB cable will depend on your requirements)","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started-with-the-wlanpi","text":"To get started with the WLANPi, you're going to need to get hold of some WLANPi hardware.
