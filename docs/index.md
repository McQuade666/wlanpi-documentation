Welcome to the WLANPi documentation site. 

The WLANPi initiative started at the [Wireless LAN Professionals Conference][WLPC_2016] in 2016. Since then, the WLANPi has grown in to a popular addition to the toolset of many WLAN engineers. The project is constantly adding and improving the tools avaiable on the WLANPi platform to provide a richer toolset to our loyal base of users. 

This site has been created to provide supporting documentation to the project, to make the WLANPi even more accessible to new and exiting users.

On this site we will provide information to enable you to buy or build your own WLANPi, detail the packages available on the current WLANPi image and provide update information about the WLANPi project.

If you're new to the WLANPi project, a great place to start is out [Getting Started][Getting_Started] page.
