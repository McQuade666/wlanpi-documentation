Publishing Cheat Sheet
----------------------

The WLANPi documentation is created and published using MKDocs. More info at : https://www.mkdocs.org/#mkdocs

The docs are contained in a GitHub repo and are then built in a GitHub project page. The current published site can be found at: https://wlan-pi.github.io/wlanpi-documentation/

The site can be built locally on your machine and pre-viewed using the 'mkdocs serve' command before pushing to GitHub.

Once edits have bene completed, they can be built and pushed to the GitHub project page created to host the final pages. See the following doc for more info: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/
